			<p>It was the custom of the Honourable <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Listless, on adjourning from the bottle to the ladies, to retire for a few moments to make a second toilette, that he might present himself in becoming taste. Fatout, attending as usual, appeared with a countenance of great dismay, and informed his master that he had just ascertained that the abbey was haunted. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Hilary’s <em>gentlewoman</em>, for whom Fatout had lately conceived a <i xml:lang="fr">tendresse</i>, had been, as she expressed it, “fritted out of her seventeen senses” the preceding night, as she was retiring to her bedchamber, by a ghastly figure which she had met stalking along one of the galleries, wrapped in a white shroud, with a bloody turban on its head. She had fainted away with fear; and, when she recovered, she found herself in the dark, and the figure was gone. “<i xml:lang="fr">Sacre⁠—cochon⁠—bleu</i>!” exclaimed Fatout, giving very deliberate emphasis to every portion of his terrible oath⁠—“I vould not meet de <i xml:lang="fr">revenant</i>, de ghost⁠—<i xml:lang="fr">non</i>⁠—not for all de <i xml:lang="fr">bowl-de-ponch</i> in de vorld.”</p>
			<p>“Fatout,” said the Honourable <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Listless, “did I ever see a ghost?”</p>
			<p>“<i xml:lang="fr">Jamais</i>, monsieur, never.”</p>
			<p>“Then I hope I never shall, for, in the present shattered state of my nerves, I am afraid it would be too much for me. There⁠—loosen the lace of my stays a little, for really this plebeian practice of eating⁠—Not too loose⁠—consider my shape. That will do. And I desire that you bring me no more stories of ghosts; for, though I do not believe in such things, yet, when one is awake in the night, one is apt, if one thinks of them, to have fancies that give one a kind of a chill, particularly if one opens one’s eyes suddenly on one’s dressing gown, hanging in the moonlight, between the bed and the window.”</p>
			<p>The Honourable <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Listless, though he had prohibited Fatout from bringing him any more stories of ghosts, could not help thinking of that which Fatout had already brought; and, as it was uppermost in his mind, when he descended to the tea and coffee cups, and the rest of the company in the library, he almost involuntarily asked <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Flosky, whom he looked up to as a most oraculous personage, whether any story of any ghost that had ever appeared to anyone, was entitled to any degree of belief?</p>

						<p>I once saw a ghost myself, in my study, which is the last place where anyone but a ghost would look for me. I had not been into it for three months, and was going to consult Tillotson, when, on opening the door, I saw a venerable figure in a flannel dressing gown, sitting in my armchair, and reading my Jeremy Taylor. It vanished in a moment, and so did I; and what it was or what it wanted I have never been able to ascertain.</p>

						<p>It was an idea with the force of a sensation. It is seldom that ghosts appeal to two senses at once; but, when I was in Devonshire, the following story was well attested to me. A young woman, whose lover was at sea, returning one evening over some solitary fields, saw her lover sitting on a stile over which she was to pass. Her first emotions were surprise and joy, but there was a paleness and seriousness in his face that made them give place to alarm. She advanced towards him, and he said to her, in a solemn voice, “The eye that hath seen me shall see me no more. Thine eye is upon me, but I am not.” And with these words he vanished; and on that very day and hour, as it afterwards appeared, he had perished by shipwreck.</p>

						<p>All these anecdotes admit of solution on psychological principles. It is more easy for a soldier, a philosopher, or even a saint, to be frightened at his own shadow, than for a dead man to come out of his grave. Medical writers cite a thousand singular examples of the force of imagination. Persons of feeble, nervous, melancholy temperament, exhausted by fever, by labour, or by spare diet, will readily conjure up, in the magic ring of their own fantasy, spectres, gorgons, chimaeras, and all the objects of their hatred and their love. We are most of us like Don Quixote, to whom a windmill was a giant, and Dulcinea a magnificent princess: all more or less the dupes of our own imagination, though we do not all go so far as to see ghosts, or to fancy ourselves pipkins and teapots.</p>

			<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Flosky fixed his eyes on a door at the farther end of the library. The company looked in the same direction. The door silently opened, and a ghastly figure, shrouded in white drapery, with the semblance of a bloody turban on its head, entered and stalked slowly up the apartment. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Flosky, familiar as he was with ghosts, was not prepared for this apparition, and made the best of his way out at the opposite door. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Hilary and Marionetta followed, screaming. The Honourable <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Listless, by two turns of his body, rolled first off the sofa and then under it. The Reverend <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Larynx leaped up and fled with so much precipitation, that he overturned the table on the foot of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Glowry. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Glowry roared with pain in the ear of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Toobad. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Toobad’s alarm so bewildered his senses, that, missing the door, he threw up one of the windows, jumped out in his panic, and plunged over head and ears in the moat. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Asterias and his son, who were on the watch for their mermaid, were attracted by the splashing, threw a net over him, and dragged him to land.</p>
			<p>Scythrop and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hilary meanwhile had hastened to his assistance, and, on arriving at the edge of the moat, followed by several servants with ropes and torches, found <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Asterias and Aquarius busy in endeavouring to extricate <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Toobad from the net, who was entangled in the meshes, and floundering with rage. Scythrop was lost in amazement; but <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hilary saw, at one view, all the circumstances of the adventure, and burst into an immoderate fit of laughter; on recovering from which, he said to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Asterias, “You have caught an odd fish, indeed.” <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Toobad was highly exasperated at this unseasonable pleasantry; but <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hilary softened his anger, by producing a knife, and cutting the Gordian knot of his reticular envelopment. “You see,” said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Toobad, “you see, gentlemen, in my unfortunate person proof upon proof of the present dominion of the devil in the affairs of this world; and I have no doubt but that the apparition of this night was Apollyon himself in disguise, sent for the express purpose of terrifying me into this complication of misadventures. The devil is come among you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.”</p>
