			<p>Marionetta felt secure of Scythrop’s heart; and notwithstanding the difficulties that surrounded her, she could not debar herself from the pleasure of tormenting her lover, whom she kept in a perpetual fever. Sometimes she would meet him with the most unqualified affection; sometimes with the most chilling indifference; rousing him to anger by artificial coldness⁠—softening him to love by eloquent tenderness⁠—or inflaming him to jealousy by coquetting with the Honourable <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Listless, who seemed, under her magical influence, to burst into sudden life, like the bud of the evening primrose. Sometimes she would sit by the piano, and listen with becoming attention to Scythrop’s pathetic remonstrances; but, in the most impassioned part of his oratory, she would convert all his ideas into a chaos, by striking up some Rondo Allegro, and saying, “Is it not pretty?” Scythrop would begin to storm; and she would answer him with,</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:song">
				<p>
					<span>“<i xml:lang="it">Zitti, zitti, piano, piano,</i></span>
					<br/>
					<span><i xml:lang="it">Non facciamo confusione,</i>”</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>or some similar <i xml:lang="it">facezia</i>, till he would start away from her, and enclose himself in his tower, in an agony of agitation, vowing to renounce her, and her whole sex, forever; and returning to her presence at the summons of the billet, which she never failed to send with many expressions of penitence and promises of amendment. Scythrop’s schemes for regenerating the world, and detecting his seven golden candlesticks, went on very slowly in this fever of his spirit.</p>
			<p>Things proceeded in this train for several days; and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Glowry began to be uneasy at receiving no intelligence from <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Toobad; when one evening the latter rushed into the library, where the family and the visitors were assembled, vociferating, “The devil is come among you, having great wrath!” He then drew <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Glowry aside into another apartment, and after remaining some time together, they re-entered the library with faces of great dismay, but did not condescend to explain to anyone the cause of their discomfiture.</p>
			<p>The next morning, early, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Toobad departed. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Glowry sighed and groaned all day, and said not a word to anyone. Scythrop had quarrelled, as usual, with Marionetta, and was enclosed in his tower, in a fit of morbid sensibility. Marionetta was comforting herself at the piano, with singing the airs of <i xml:lang="it">Nina pazza per amore</i>; and the Honourable <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Listless was listening to the harmony, as he lay supine on the sofa, with a book in his hand, into which he peeped at intervals. The Reverend <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Larynx approached the sofa, and proposed a game at billiards.</p>

			<p>A parcel was brought in for <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Listless; it had been sent express. Fatout was summoned to unpack it; and it proved to contain a new novel, and a new poem, both of which had long been anxiously expected by the whole host of fashionable readers; and the last number of a popular Review, of which the editor and his coadjutors were in high favour at court, and enjoyed ample pensions<a href="../text/endnotes.xhtml#note-5" id="noteref-5" epub:type="noteref">5</a> for their services to church and state. As Fatout left the room, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Flosky entered, and curiously inspected the literary arrivals.</p>

							<p>Why, sir, I cannot say that I am indeed particularly fond of books; yet neither can I say that I never do read. A tale or a poem, now and then, to a circle of ladies over their work, is no very heterodox employment of the vocal energy. And I must say, for myself, that few men have a more Job-like endurance of the eternally recurring questions and answers that interweave themselves, on these occasions, with the crisis of an adventure, and heighten the distress of a tragedy.</p>

			<p>The conversation was interrupted by the reappearance of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Toobad, covered with mud. He just showed himself at the door, muttered “The devil is come among you!” and vanished. The road which connected Nightmare Abbey with the civilised world, was artificially raised above the level of the fens, and ran through them in a straight line as far as the eye could reach, with a ditch on each side, of which the water was rendered invisible by the aquatic vegetation that covered the surface. Into one of these ditches the sudden action of a shy horse, which took fright at a windmill, had precipitated the travelling chariot of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Toobad, who had been reduced to the necessity of scrambling in dismal plight through the window. One of the wheels was found to be broken; and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Toobad, leaving the postilion to get the chariot as well as he could to Claydyke for the purpose of cleaning and repairing, had walked back to Nightmare Abbey, followed by his servant with the imperial, and repeating all the way his favourite quotation from the Revelations.</p>
